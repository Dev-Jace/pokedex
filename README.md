Potential functionality improvements to make:
 - Update the CLI to support the "up" arrow to cycle through previous commands
 - Simulate battles between pokemon
 - - make all moves that could normally be learned available
   - make a "stamina" to limit move spamming
 - Add more unit tests
 - Refactor your code to organize it better and make it more testable
 - - make a commands folder
 - Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up
 - - xp for battling mon based on input vs lvl diff
 - Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
 - - alternately use an exp gauge to follow the games better
   - - add an exp penalty for when/if pokemon faint
 - Persist a user's Pokedex to disk so they can save progress between sessions
 - Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
 - - alternately, use current location to dictate what location you can go to next
 - Random encounters with wild pokemon
 - Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), which have different chances of catching pokemon
